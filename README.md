## Problem Statement
AtliQ Motors, a leading automotive company from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV), has experienced significant growth in the North American EV and hybrid market, reaching 25% market share over the past five years.

The aim of the study is to identify opportunities and challenges before launching their bestselling models in India.
